# Plant Disease Prediction using CNN 
 Classification using Convolutional Neural Network

In this project, we will create a Convolutional Neural Network which will be able to predict whether a plant is suffering from a disease. We will use different layers and other hyperparameters for building, training, and testing this classification model. We will be using tensorflow and keras for this project.
